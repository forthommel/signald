# signald 0.7.0

## New Features
* Ability to list remote safety numbers, control trust thereof. Listing via the `get_identities`, trusting via new `trust` command.
* Ability to create and edit contacts. Use `update_contact` command.

## Developer Tooling
* The CI has been configured to check for updates to all dependencies listed in `build.gradle` and open a merge request when there are updates

## Bug Fixes
* Registration was broken. The immediate problem was addressed in 1ab4f68997b98a189ef3a51f753b6b61d4e55eb5, but the larger problem of there being no tests is still being resolved (see branch `feature/tests`).
* Fixed a compile-time warning about unsafe or unchecked operations in `JsonGroupInfo.java`.
* Fixed a runtime warning about missing logging libraries.
